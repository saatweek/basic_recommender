# Notes on the dataset

- Ratings dataset has all the users and what rating they gave to the movie, and it also has the timestamps. Are those timestamps referring to when they rated the movie? If so then it might be worth investigating if their preference change over time. Or maybe they watch exciting movies with their friends on the weekends, but like watching artistic films on the weekends when they're mostly alone?
